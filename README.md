# This project is for Portland State CS 410/510 Front-end Web Dev

The project was created by @tritam and @joemdevlin .

# About the website

Our Spending Watch Dog site contains charts and graphs related to the categories of spending, budgeting, funding, and debt of the United States. Selected this because we simply thought it would be interesting to get a collective visual of the data. On this site, you will find graphs that will display funding by state, historical agency funding, agency funding, and overall debt.

This project uses data from [US Spending](https://usaspending.gov) and [US Treasury](http://transparency.treasury.gov).
